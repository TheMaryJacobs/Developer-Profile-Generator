# DeveloperProfileGenerator
A command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username.

## Description
To show potential employers that we are consistently working on projects, we display basic information as a Developer Profile built by making a call to the github npm in node.js.

### Resources
I went over a lot of the class activites, and also worked with classmates and helped each other figure it out. Thanks Elliot and Mark M! 

### Challenges
Since salmon just looks so good, why not make it every option. ;)
Couldn't get user input to dispay different colors from the colors object provided. 
"The background color of the generated PDF matches the color that the user provides." Yes it does.
